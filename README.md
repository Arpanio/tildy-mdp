This is a fun project, inspired by talk of richard sutton - [Tutorial: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqnxyjaKe4)

Here the user is a reinforcement learning agent and he tries to find the optimal policy to gain maximum rewards. The environment has two states A and B. User can take 2 actions - 1,2 . Based on user's action in a state he gets positive or negative reward/feedback.

If you decide to play this game then following is the optimal policy

| State        | Action           |
| ------------ |:----------------:|
| A            | 2                |
| B            | 1                |

This repository can be used for educational purposes. This repo can be used to explain the following concepts of Reinforcement Learning - 
- MDP
- Exploration vs Exploitation Dilemma
- Introduction to RL.
